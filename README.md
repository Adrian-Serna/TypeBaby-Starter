# TypeBaby-Starter
## Babylonjs and Typescript starter for Babylon 4.2 

A Babylon and Typescript starter transpiled with webpack, results in a javascript, with connection interfaces of its main functions, to be accessible from external scripts and events.

The html inside the public folder is just an example of how to call javascript from the body, with a basic configuration of css fullscreen. This html is not compiled on implementation.

The starting point of this starter has been Tim Okolowski's repository at https://github.com/oktinaut/babylonjs-typescript-starter with modifications in the webpack configuration, the update and inclusion of babylonjs libraries and the creation of connection interfaces of some functions with the outside world.
